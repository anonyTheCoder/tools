# üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Network Flood Simulator (For Educational/Lab Use Only)

> **Disclaimer:** This program is intended **only for testing on your own servers or lab environments**. Unauthorized use against external systems or networks is illegal and can have serious consequences.

This project demonstrates **network packet generation, multithreading, and basic DoS simulation techniques** in C. It supports multiple protocols, including UDP, TCP, ICMP, HTTP, and raw protocols, and allows you to experiment with payloads, ports, and IP spoofing in a controlled environment.

## üöÄ Features

- Multi-threaded packet sending for high throughput.  
- Supports multiple protocols:  
  - **UDP**: Randomized source ports and payloads.  
  - **TCP**: SYN flood simulation.  
  - **ICMP**: Echo request (ping) simulation.  
  - **HTTP**: TCP-based GET request flood (no spoofing).  
  - **RAW**: Custom protocol simulation with spoofed headers.  
- Configurable packet rate per thread.  
- Randomized payloads and source ports for realistic traffic simulation.  
- IP spoofing support (except for HTTP).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Requirements
- Linux OS (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)  
- C compiler (`gcc`)  
- Root privileges (required for raw sockets)  

### Install necessary packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential


‚öôÔ∏è Compilation
gcc -pthread -o flood_simulator flood_simulator.c


Note: You must run the program as root if using raw sockets:
sudo ./flood_simulator ...

üìå Usage
sudo ./flood_simulator <target_ip> <port> [rate_per_thread] [threads] [randomize_payload 0/1] [randomize_src_port 0/1] [protocol udp/tcp/icmp/http/raw] [proto_num for raw]

Parameters
Parameter	Description
target_ip	IP of your local test server or lab machine
port	Target port (ignored for ICMP/RAW, default 80 for HTTP)
rate_per_thread	Packets per second per thread (default: 100000)
threads	Number of threads (default: 4)
randomize_payload	0 = fixed payload, 1 = random payload (default: 1)
randomize_src_port	0 = fixed port, 1 = random port (default: 1)
protocol	Protocol to use: udp, tcp, icmp, http, raw
proto_num	Required for RAW mode (e.g., 255)
Examples

UDP Flood (default settings):

sudo ./flood_simulator 127.0.0.1 80


TCP SYN Flood, 200k packets/sec, 8 threads:

sudo ./flood_simulator 127.0.0.1 80 200000 8 1 1 tcp


HTTP GET Flood:

./flood_simulator 127.0.0.1 80 5000 4 0 0 http


Raw Packet Simulation (protocol 255):

sudo ./flood_simulator 127.0.0.1 0 100000 4 1 1 raw 255

üîß How It Works

Multithreading: Each thread continuously sends packets to maximize throughput.

Protocol Handling: TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, and RAW are handled differently with their respective headers.

Spoofing & Randomization: Source IPs, ports, and payloads can be randomized to simulate realistic traffic.

Checksums: IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP checksums are calculated for raw packets to ensure validity.

Delays: usleep() controls packets per second per thread.

‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

Always run on local or controlled lab machines.

Using raw sockets requires root privileges.

Avoid testing on external networks ‚Äî it‚Äôs illegal.

Use htop or top to monitor CPU usage; high packet rates can max out resources.

üéØ Learning Outcomes

Low-level socket programming in C.

Understanding of network protocols (IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP).

How multithreading and rate control affect network traffic.

Implementing checksums and raw packet manipulation.

If you want, I can also make a **more visual version with badges, emojis for each protocol, and sections for ‚ÄúScreenshots / Stats / Notes‚Äù** so it looks more like a **professional GitHub project**.  

Do you want me to do that?
